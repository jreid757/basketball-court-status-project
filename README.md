# basketball-court-status-project
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective DevOps workflow that auto-deploys a static website hosted on AWS S3. Every time I push updates to my GitHub repository, such as changes to an index.html file reflecting basketball court status, GitHub Actions kicks off a CI/CD pipeline that seamlessly updates the S3 bucket.
